Early Java Version of a game that includes a evolving character and pool ball physics.

This is the early PC version of the game, I may create a repository for the more advanced 
Android version later.

Notably in this version of the game the graphics are also on the timer thread. This is not the best way to do 
things so Android version will not.



In order to play: 

knock the smaller gray character with your mouse while the left mouse button 
is pressed to knock him. Try to get the larger gray monsters to eat the other characters intead 
of the small grey one. 
When you beat a level you gain more lives and the gray character changes
color and gains abilities depending one which other small character is left at the end.
(But in this version the ability test returns true no matter what
So you can shoot air to push chacter and others by clicking on the screen and 
click on the character to stop him)
